#### DBScan ([Link](https://github.com/Vitomir84/ML_algorithms/blob/main/DBScan%20clustering%20algorithm.ipynb))
DBscan is clustering algorithm but it, unlike K-means, does not have centroids, so it is more sensitive to the nonlinear patterns of connections between features we want to group and identify hidden paterns. DBScan thus uses radius and group values of the data if they belong in to the area of some hypotesised radius.
In this script we loop for different noise hyperparameter on toy data set and find different precision of solution.
